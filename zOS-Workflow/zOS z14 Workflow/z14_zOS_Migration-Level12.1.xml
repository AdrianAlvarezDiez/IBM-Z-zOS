		<description><![CDATA[  
			<h6>Introduction</h6>  
			<p>The IBM z14™ (z14™) is designed to be the cornerstone for a trust economy. The z14 provides a scalable, highly available platform that delivers differentiated value to enable business growth, reduce cost, and protect existing investments. z/OS V2R3 enhances the role of the z14 by supporting solutions for a trusted digital economy. Capabilities that are designed to optimize high availability, performance, security, and operational flexibility can help organizations grow and secure their most critical transaction environments.</p>  
			<p>The IBM z14 family of mainframes includes the following models, which are dual frame configurations: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05. The newest addition to the IBM z14 family, the IBM z14™ Model ZR1 (z14 ZR1), is a single frame configuration. The z14 ZR1 is designed for clients who do not need the capacity of the larger M01-M05 models.</p>  
			<p>In this document, references to "z14" pertain to all models of the IBM z14, including the z14 Model ZR1, unless otherwise noted.</p>  
			<p>z/OS base support for specific z14 functions depends on the z/OS release. 
				<a href="#z14__znextfuncbc">Table 29</a> lists the z14 functions and indicates whether each function is included in a specific z/OS release (Yes or No), or whether the function requires a PTF (PTF) or a web deliverable (Web). For information about finding the appropriate PTFs, see 
				<a href="#z14before-main">Actions you can take before you order an IBM z14 server</a>. For more information about V1R13 support, see the 
				<em>Table Notes</em>.

		<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
			<strong>IBMRSM,ZOSMIGV2R3_RSM_Minimum_Real</strong>. 
			<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
			<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
			<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>The base support for the z14 is delivered through service (PTFs). To determine which PTFs are required, get the current enhanced HOLDDATA file, either by using the 
					<strong>SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER</strong> command or by downloading the 2-year file and using the 
					<strong>SMP/E RECEIVE</strong> command to process it. Then, use the 
					<strong>SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX</strong> report to identify the missing PTFs, if any. For example:
				</p>  
				<pre> 
<code>SET BDY(GLOBAL). REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES(target zone) FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.*.RequiredService).</code>
				</pre>  
				<p>If you want more granular reports for REPORT MISSINGFIX, you can use the individual FIXCATs for each server, plus the FIXCATs for any intermediate services. The FIXCATs for the z14 servers are:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05, the FIXCAT for z14 required service is: IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RequiredService.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>For IBM z14 Model ZR1, the FIXCAT for z14 required service is: IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RequiredService.</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>Exploitation of some functions requires a web deliverable. Specifically:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>Exploitation of the Crypto Express6S requires the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 - z/OS V2R3 (FMID HCR77C1) web deliverable.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>If you are using this web deliverable and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the following fix category: IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R1-V2R3-HCR77C1</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support, which includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX Reduction/simplification, additional EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization Stats, then you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1).</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77A1 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1 or IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1.</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1).</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>When you change coupling facility control code (CFCC) levels, your coupling facility structure sizes might change. If, as part of your migration to the z14 server, you change CFCC levels, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFCC levels are identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CF Level 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFCC Level 22, introduced on the z14, supports the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools (GBP). This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.</p>

				<p>Not all z14 functions are available in every z/OS release. For a list of the z14 functions available in each z/OS release, see Table 29 and Table 30 in the step 
					<em>"Migrate to an IBM z14 server."</em> Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see the steps 
					<em>"Actions you can take before you order an IBM z14 server"</em> and 
					<em>"Actions you can take after you install an IBM z14 server."</em>) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you plan to exploit new z14 functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to exploit first, then upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to exploit the new functions.

			<title>z14 servers in a sysplex</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>A Parallel Sysplex that contains a z14 server either for a z/OS image or a coupling facility (CF) image can only contain other z14 servers, or z13, z13s, zEC12, or zBC12 servers.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>Note that no coupling link connectivity is possible between IBM zEC12 and IBM zBC12 systems and the IBM z14 Model ZR1. Other systems, such as the z13, z13s, and z14, can connect to the z14 Model ZR1 by using the Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR) coupling links. The zEC12 and zBC12 systems do not support ICA SR or CE LR, and therefore cannot have coupling link connectivity to the z14 Model ZR1. Also, the InfiniBand coupling links are not supported on the z14 Model ZR1.</p>  
				<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a zEC12 or zBC12 server, you cannot add a z14 server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z14 server if you have any of the earlier servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
				<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to zEC12, zBC12, or later to have z14 servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a z14 server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a zEC12, zBC12, or later server before introducing the z14 server.</p>  
				<p>GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signaling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signaling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>Starting with z13, servers that require time synchronization (for example, to support a base or Parallel Sysplex) must be configured in Server Time Protocol (STP) mode. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other, in a coordinated timing network (CTN). STP is a hardware feature of the IBM z14 (z14), z13, z13s, zEC12, and zBC12. The most recent servers (z14, z13, and z13s) can participate only in an STP-only CTN.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>Starting with the z14 and the IBM Hardware Management Console (HMC) Version 2.14.0, you can use the 
					<strong>Manage System Time</strong> task to configure an STP-only CTN. This task provides a simplified workflow for system time management, and features a visual topology display that surfaces configuration errors, if any, in the CTN.

						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>STP Mixed CTN. The zEC12 and zBC12 were the last IBM Z® servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). Starting with the z13, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>IBM zEnterprise Application Assist Processor (zAAP). IBM continues to support running zAAP workloads on IBM z® Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs). IBM has removed the restriction preventing zAAP-eligible workloads from running on zIIPs when a zAAP is installed on the CEC. This change was intended to help facilitate migration and testing of zAAP workloads on zIIPs. With a z14, one CP must be installed with the installation of any zIIPs or prior to the installation of any zIIPs. The total number of zIIPs purchased cannot exceed twice the number of CPs purchased. However, for upgrades from zEC12s with zAAPs, conversions from zAAPs can increase this ratio to 4:1.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>IBM recommends that you use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command to identify PTFs for the z14 server that you do not already have installed. The simplest way to do that is to specify IBM.Device.Server.* and IBM.Function.* as the fix categories for the REPORT MISSINGFIX command. Doing so will identify not only z14 support PTFs, but those for prior generations of IBM servers that you might need, and those required to enable various functions. Also, REPORT MISSINGFIX creates a batch job for the SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER command that you can use to get any PTFs you do not already have. SMP/E also provides an Explorer function that you can use to find new fix categories that might be of interest. For a description of all the fix categories, see the Values and Descriptions page at 
					<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html" target="_blank">IBM Fix Category Values and Descriptions (www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html)</a>. For more information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
					<cite>SMP/E for z/OS Commands</cite>.
				</p>  
				<p>Here is an example of the SMP/E control statements you can use for REPORT MISSINGFIX:</p>  
				<pre> 
<code>SET BDY(GLOBAL) . REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES(target zone) FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.* IBM.Function.*) .</code>
				</pre>  
				<p>If you want to use specific fix categories, you can specify the following fix categories either individually or together for the z/OS PTFs that are required to use a z14 server, exploit its functions and features, and those that IBM recommends you install if you are using a z14 server. Also needed are the FIXCATs for intermediate processors.</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05:</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RequiredService</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.Exploitation</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RecommendedService</li> 
				</ul>  
				<ul> 
					<li>For IBM z14 Model ZR1:</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RequiredService</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.Exploitation</li>  
					<li>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RecommendedService</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>In addition, if you choose to use specific fix categories, your environment might require that you specify one or more of these fix categories:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li>IBM.Function.DataSetEncryption</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.PricingInfrastructure</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.zEDC</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.zHighPerformanceFICON</li>  
					<li>IBM.Function.zHyperLink</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>If you are exploiting z14 capabilities by installing a web deliverable, additional PTFs might be required. Follow the instructions in the Program Directory that is associated with each web deliverable to identify the required PTFs.</p>  
				<p>Another way to find required PTFs is by using Preventive Service Planning (PSP) "buckets." In addition to the applicable hardware PSP buckets, you must also obtain the software PSP buckets. The hardware PSP bucket lists the recommended, required, and exploitation PTFs, and also includes information about the appropriate fix categories that are needed to identify those PTFs. However, using PSP buckets and checking on the status of the PTFs listed in them is more time-consuming and potentially error-prone than using REPORT MISSINGFIX with the appropriate fix categories.</p>  
				<p>PSP buckets for the z14 server are identified by an Upgrade name, and have Subset names, as follows:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05, the z14 PSP Upgrade name is 3906DEVICE, and the z/OS support can be found in Subset 3906/ZOS.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>For IBM z14 Model ZR1, the z14 PSP Upgrade name is 3907DEVICE, and the z/OS support can be found in Subset 3907/ZOS.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>

			<title>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>The instruction set has been expanded on the z14 server, as is usual for new servers. Each machine instruction is represented by a mnemonic in Assembler language. The new mnemonics can be identical to the names you chose for Assembler macro instructions. In the event of such naming collisions, the Assembler's default opcode table (UNI) processes new mnemonics as instructions, not as macros, after z14 required service has been installed. If this occurs, it is likely to cause Assembler error messages and can cause incorrect object code to be generated. If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of Assembler macro instructions that are used to the new machine instructions (documented in the latest 
					<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832) to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. Identical names cause Assembler errors or the generation of incorrect object code when you assemble your programs. For information about a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
					<a href="http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs" target="_blank">IBM Techdocs (www.ibm.com/support/techdocs)</a>. Search for the Techdoc "PRS5289".
				</p>  
				<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>Change the name of your macro instruction.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Specify PARM=’...OPTABLE(YOP)...’ (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use a coding technique that permits both use of a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly such as HLASM mnemonic tags ( :MAC :ASM).</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>

				<p>Starting with z/OS V2R3, the default ARCH level is changed from ARCH(8) to ARCH(10), and the default TUNE level is changed from TUNE(8) to TUNE(10). The new default levels align with the zEC12; thus, code can run on any server that is supported by z/OS V2R3 without requiring changes to compiler options.</p>  
				<p>The z14™ supports the new levels ARCH(12) and TUNE(12), which are needed to take advantage of the new z14 instructions, and are intended to provide performance improvements for applications. ARCH(12) produces code that uses instructions that are available on the z14 in z/Architecture mode. The z14 adds instructions for vector programming, including allowing packed decimal operations to be performed in registers rather than memory. TUNE(12) generates code that is executable on all models, but is optimized for the z14.</p>

				</p> Note: As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available because that is where future enhancements are made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.

				<h6>Description</h6>  
				<p>The z14™ is the last IBM Z® high-end server to support HCA3-O fanout (#0171) and HCA3-O LR fanout for 1x IFB (#0170).</p> Note: The z14 Model ZR1 does not support the HCA3-O or the HCA3-O LR coupling fanouts. This model requires ICA-SR and CE-LR fanouts. 
				<p>Enterprises should begin migrating from HCA3-O and HCA3-O LR channels to one of the following coupling links on the z14, z13, and z13s.</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>For high-speed short-range coupling connectivity, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR). The ICA SR is a two-port, short-distance coupling fanout that uses a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z14, z13, and z13s servers. The ICA SR fanout requires new cabling, and can only connect to another ICA SR.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>For long-range coupling connectivity, the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR). The CE LR is a two-port, long-distance coupling adapter that uses a new coupling channel type: CL5. The CE LR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z14, z13, and z13s servers.</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>The suggested practice is to order ICA SR (#0172) or CE LR (#0433) on the z14 processors that are used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future processor generations.</p> Note: IBM's statements regarding its plans, directions, and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice at IBM's sole discretion.
